In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Pitt was involved in successive relationships with several of his co-stars, including Robin Givens (Head of the Class),[196] Jill Schoelen (Cutting Class),[196] and Juliette Lewis (Too Young to Die? and Kalifornia).[32] In addition, Pitt had a much-publicized romance and engagement to his Seven co-star, Gwyneth Paltrow, whom he dated from 1994 to 1997.[196]Pitt met actress Jennifer Aniston in 1998 and they married in a private wedding ceremony in Malibu on July 29, 2000.[197] In January 2005, Pitt and Aniston announced they had decided to separate. Two months later, Aniston filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.[198] Pitt and Aniston's divorce was finalized by the Los Angeles Superior Court on October 2, 2005.[198] Despite media reports that Pitt and Aniston had an acrimonious relationship, Pitt said in a February 2009 interview that he and Aniston "check in with each other", adding that they were both big parts of each other's lives.[199]During Pitt's divorce proceedings, his involvement with his Mr. & Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie attracted media attention. Jolie and Pitt stated that they fell in love on the set[200][201] and that there was no infidelity.[200] In April 2005, one month after Aniston filed for divorce, a set of paparazzi photographs emerged showing Pitt, Jolie, and her son Maddox at a beach in Kenya; the press interpreted the pictures as evidence of a relationship between Pitt and Jolie. Throughout 2005, the two were seen together with increasing frequency, and the entertainment media dubbed the couple "Brangelina".[202] On January 11, 2006, Jolie confirmed to People that she was pregnant with Pitt's child, thereby publicly acknowledging their relationship for the first time.[203] Pitt and Jolie announced their engagement in April 2012 after seven years together.[204] They were married on August 23, 2014, in a private ceremony in Château Miraval, France.[205] On September 19, 2016, Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt, citing irreconcilable differences.[206] On April 12, 2019, the court restored Jolie and Pitt to single status[207] and they were declared divorced.</p>
